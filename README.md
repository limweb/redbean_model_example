# What

A Model structure that wraps [RedBean](http://redbeanphp.com/) and is loaded via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

It includes an abstract BaseModel class and a Customer class that extends it.

Sample usage can be found in test.php.

This is just a stupid demo I made for a friend who is trying to learn PHP.

# Usage

    composer.phar install
    php test.php
